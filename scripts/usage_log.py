"""The usage log: one line per run of a script or a recipe (docs/workflow.md § 5).

`logs/usage.log`, local and never committed: time, tool, duration, result, separated
by tabs. The flow audit reads it after a release, then empties it. Nothing is written
in CI, nor when `USAGE_LOG=off` (the script tests); `USAGE_LOG=<path>` moves the file.

A tool reaches the log in one of three ways:
  - a Python script calls `usage_log.start()` first thing in its `__main__` block;
  - a shell script sources `scripts/usage-log.sh`;
  - a recipe that runs no script depends on `(_used "<recipe>")` in the justfile.

Writing the log never fails the tool: an error here is swallowed.

A Python script leaves through `sys.exit`: a raised `SystemExit` passes neither of the two
ways out noted here and would be logged as `ok`. Two runs that cap the file at the same
moment can lose a line. A script that only CI runs, or that is copied elsewhere before it
runs, does not log.
